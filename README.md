# Material Design component library for Sketch
Makes use of Sketch's new libraries feature to provide a set of components to make development of Material Design-based UIs quick and painless.

Structure is based on Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology to quickly create object-oriented designs.

## Usage
Clone this repo locally. Create a new Sketch file to begin building your new design within. _Do not edit the library file directly._

In your new Sketch file, go to Sketch > Preferences, then select the Libraries tab and make sure the sketch-material.sketch file is present and active.

On the Insert menu you should now have a submenu named sketch-material. Select elements from this menu to add to your document to begin building up a UI.

Many elements have configuration options including style choices and states which can be adjusted from the right hand panel once placed on the page. 

## Typography
Use the [Shared Text Styles](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles) plugin to import text styles into your dependent sketch files, as these won't be shared as part of attaching this library file.
