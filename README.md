# Material Design component library for Sketch
Makes use of Sketch's new libraries feature to provide a set of components to make development of Material Design-based UIs quick and painless.

Structure is based on Brad Frost's Atomic Design methodology to quickly create object-oriented designs.

## Typography
Use the [Shared Text Styles](https://github.com/nilshoenson/shared-text-styles) plugin to import text styles into your dependent sketch files, as these won't be shared as part of attaching this library file.
